      <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">A promising high school multi-sport athlete. 
        He has played for many teams, in school, where he can be found playing 
        Badminton, Volleyball, Soccer, and Basketball, although he hasnâ€™t found 
        much success since he came to high school. He has also participated in 
        numerous clubs, like Dixie Soccer Club, where he was part of a team that 
        was determined to pursue a finals trophy. Outside of sports, (name) seems 
        to an average student, with some exceptional academic qualities in courses 
        involving Math and Physics. Aside from those qualities, he loves learning 
        new things (except when it comes to coding and cooking). Hence, his first 
        coding project. 

        At the moment, he looks forward to the idea of going to an engineering university after finishing high school and pursuing a career which is in demand not only at the moment, but possibly in the future as well, for example: computer engineering, civil engineering, etc.
