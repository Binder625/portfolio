        most recent work, a website (https://8410151.wixsite.com/pandemicencyclopedia) on numerous branches of 
        engineering and their future (income, demand, automation or AIâ€™s effects, etc). Aside from creating a 
        website using wix.com which helped him in effectively learning about the numerous branches of engineering 
        while researching sufficient information to later add to his website, doing tech design projects like designing 
        a house using computer software, and taking a business course where he learned about the fundamentals of finance 
        and marketing, (name) has no tech experience related to coding, making this his first coding project. Currently, 
        he is attempting to understand code while learning different programming languages to expand his knowledge which may, 
        although unlikely, help him in making a decision for what career he should pursue.
