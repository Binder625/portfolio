    <h3>A Brief Introduction</h3>
    <p>I have always been interested in the technology that is being introduced to us every year. 
        But as I grew up, I became more aware of the technology that we use in our everyday lives 
        and how rapidly we are progressing as a species towards a better future. 
        I have been fascinated by people like Elon Musk and Neil Degrass Tyson who continue 
        to educate the younger generation and pave the way for future technology and computer professionals. 
        I think we should embrace a future filled with technology because it is inevitable that it will affect 
        our jobs, our education, construction, military, etc.
